Ruby script that will download tagging and talk for a given year, if one has some minimal programming experience it should be easy to change it to other mailing lists and/or other years.

Even if someone has 0 programming experience, it is still easy to configure (let me know if such instructions would be useful).

As Ruby script it requires Ruby to run. I see that it assumes that curl and gunzip commands exist on the system.

(if you want it to run but anything is unclear, let me know using https://github.com/matkoniecz/mailing-list-downloader/issues (create a new issue if it is not covered by one of open issues) and I will document it or try to reduce number of dependencies)
